      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Ligisa Youth Network is a community based organization founded in the
        year 2021 to provide a platform for discussing factors affecting youth
        in Homabay County and implementing projects on youth empowerment. Three
        focus areas covered by the organization are health, education and
        personal finance.

          <p>
            Substance abuse, sexually transmitted infections and early pregnancy
            are health challenges affecting many youths in Homabay County. They
            not only cause immediate lowering of quality of life but also set
            the youth on a downward spiraling path. By increasing awareness of
            these conditions in the community and facilitating access to
            information on available support the organization aims to mitigate
            the impact of these conditions. The objectives of the organization
            as regards youth health is:

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Homabay County has a primary school enrollment of 98%. This number
            reduces to about 58% in secondary school and dwindles even further
            by the time youths get to tertiary level. Reasons for dropping out
            include teenage pregnancies, lack of school fees and lack of role
            models. Ligisa will support youth to pursue education both formally
            and informally to levels they desire in the following ways:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Running computer literacy programs- through this means the world
              will be opened up to the youth and they will get motivation from
              what their peers are doing around the world. Additionally, it will
              increase their access to scholarship programs which they would
              source online.
            </li>
            <li>
              Promoting access to library services- this will provide a safe
              space for studying. It will also enable access to a wide range of
              books which will broaden the perspective of the youth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Computer based courses- these are particularly of advantage to
              youths who have limited access to finance for their studies. They
              also help the youth acquire more skills which boosts their
              employability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Life skills training- Life skills training is recommended by WHO
              in helping to reduce early pregnancy. They are helpful in
              assisting in the transition from school life to work life.
            </li>
            <li>
              Career mentorship programs- through this program the youth will be
              in a position to make informed choices on their career path. This
              will expose them to various careers which are available and help
              in choosing ones that they are passionate about.

          <p>
            The youth in Homabay County are greatly affected by poverty. This
            has far reaching consequences like promoting early sexual debut,
            dropping out of school and drug and substance abuse. There are
            limited employment opportunities in the county. Through personal
            finance classes Ligisa hopes to help change the mindset of the youth
            to create opportunities for self employment. Secondly through
            investment classes they can sustain financial stability in the long
            run. The organization will also educate the youth on how to start
            and run businesses as well as how to source for seed capital.
            Programs to be run under this department include;
